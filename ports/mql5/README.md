# Lorentzian Classification — MetaTrader 5 Port

**The official MetaTrader 5 / MQL5 port of [jdehorty](https://github.com/jdehorty)'s Lorentzian
Classification indicator — a complete, one-to-one parity port of the TradingView original, plus a
companion Expert Advisor for trading and backtesting.**

This port brings Lorentzian Classification to the MetaTrader 5 ecosystem. It ships **two pieces**,
both open source and MIT licensed:

- ✅ **`LorentzianClassification`** — the indicator: a faithful, one-to-one port of the
  TradingView original.
- ✅ **`LorentzianClassification_EA`** — a thin Expert Advisor that trades and backtests the
  indicator's signals inside MetaTrader 5.

## Parity — the whole point

This is a one-to-one port of the PineScript v6 reference: **same parameters, same names, same
defaults, the same math under the hood.** Because the behavior is identical top-to-bottom, there
is **nothing new to learn** — every input maps to the TradingView control of the same name, and
parity runs in both directions:

> Tune the indicator on TradingView and the exact settings carry straight into MetaTrader 5.
> Discover something in MetaTrader 5 — using its far deeper backtesting and optimization tools —
> and take it straight back to TradingView. Your work carries across both ecosystems and you
> don't lose a thing.

Reaching that parity leaned on what MQL5 does well. Rather than conforming Pine to Pine, parity
was driven from MetaTrader 5's ability to import **synthetic data** — including a Brownian-bridge
tick simulation — to exercise the algorithm far more deeply than replaying historical bars
allows. That depth paid off beyond the port itself: it surfaced long-standing, very minor bugs in
the original Lorentzian Classification algorithm, and the fixes directly produced the
**PineScript v6 release** of the original TradingView indicator.

## The Indicator

Drop `LorentzianClassification` onto a chart from the Navigator and it plots exactly like the
TradingView version — bar coloring, the kernel-regression estimate lines, and bullish/bearish
signal labels — with a real-time **Trade Stats** table in the corner.

<div align="center">

<sub><i>The port on EURUSD, H1 — bar-prediction "neighbor votes", kernel-regression estimate
lines, and entry/exit markers, with the in-chart Trade Stats table.</i></sub>

</div>

| On the chart | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| **Neighbor votes** | The integer beside each bar — the net vote of its nearest historical analogs. Larger magnitude ⇒ stronger directional conviction. |
| **Kernel regression estimate lines** | The smoothed rational-quadratic kernel estimate of price; crossovers drive optional smoothing and trend color. |
| **Entry** ▲ / **Exit** ▼ | Bullish and bearish signal markers, plotted where the classifier flips. |
| **Bar colors** | Colored by prediction strength; Color Compression controls intensity. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Trade Stats table is a calibration tool, not a backtest.** It gives quick real-time
> feedback (Win Rate, Trades, W/L Ratio, Early Flips) while you tune features — *"not a
> substitute for backtesting."* For real backtests, use the Strategy Tester with the EA below.

<details>
<summary><b>Settings reference</b> (one-to-one with TradingView — click to expand)</summary>

Defaults are tuned for the 4H–12H timeframes but work reasonably across others.

### General

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Source** | Close | Input data source for the classifier. |
| **Neighbors Count** | 8 | Number of nearest historical analogs to poll (1–100). |
| **Max Bars Back** | 2000 | Maximum number of historical bars used for lookups. |
| **Feature Count** | 5 | Number of features used for predictions (2–5). |
| **Color Compression** | 1 | Compression factor for the color-scale intensity (1–10). |
| **Show Exits** | ✗ | Show exit-arrow markers on the chart. |
| **Use Dynamic Exits** | ✗ | Extend the exit threshold using kernel regression to reduce premature exits. |
| **Include Full History** | ✗ | Train on the full bar history; when off, use only the most recent *Max Bars Back* bars. |
| **Show Trade Stats** | ✓ | Display the Trade Stats table (calibration only — not a backtest). |
| **Use Worst Case Estimate** | ✗ | Use bar close instead of mid-bar price for Trade Stats — a more conservative estimate. |

### Feature Engineering

Each feature accepts **Parameter A** and **Parameter B**; their meaning depends on the selected
indicator. The same indicator used with different parameters counts as two separate features.

| Feature | Parameter A | Parameter B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **RSI** | RSI period | EMA smoothing period applied to the RSI |
| **WT** (WaveTrend) | Channel length | Average length (second-stage smoothing) |
| **CCI** | CCI period | EMA smoothing period applied to the CCI |
| **ADX** | ADX period | *Not used — ADX ignores it* |

Defaults: `RSI(14,1)` · `WT(10,11)` · `CCI(20,1)` · `ADX(20,2)` *(B unused)* · `RSI(9,1)`.

### Filters

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Use Volatility Filter** | ✓ | Require recent ATR > historical ATR. |
| **Use Regime Filter** | ✓ | Kaufman-Adaptive-Slope trend-vs-ranging detection. |
| **Use ADX Filter** | ✗ | Require ADX above threshold for signal flips. |
| **Regime Threshold** | -0.1 | Trend/range cutoff (-10 to 10); higher ⇒ stronger trend required. |
| **ADX Threshold** | 20 | ADX cutoff (0–100); higher ⇒ stronger trend required. |
| **Use EMA Filter** | ✗ | Longs require close above the EMA; shorts require close below. |
| **EMA Period** | 200 | Period of the EMA filter. |
| **Use SMA Filter** | ✗ | Longs require close above the SMA; shorts require close below. |
| **SMA Period** | 200 | Period of the SMA filter. |

### Kernel Regression

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Trade with Kernel** | ✓ | Gate signals on the kernel-regression trend. |
| **Show Kernel Estimate** | ✓ | Draw the kernel estimate line on the chart. |
| **Use Kernel Smoothing** | ✗ | Crossover-based smoothing: fewer color flips, more ML entries. |
| **Lookback Window** | 8 | Bars used for estimation (min 3; recommended 3–50). |
| **Relative Weighting** | 8 | Relative weighting of timeframes (recommended 0.25–25). |
| **Start Regression at Bar** | 25 | Bar index where regression begins (recommended 2–25). |
| **Kernel Lag** | 2 | Lag for crossover detection; lower ⇒ earlier crossovers (recommended 1–2). |

### Display

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Show Bar Colors** | ✓ | Color bars by prediction. |
| **Show Bar Prediction Values** | ✓ | Print the model's per-bar evaluation as an integer. |
| **Use ATR Offset** | ✗ | Use an ATR-based offset instead of the bar-prediction offset. |
| **Bar Prediction Offset** | 0 | Offset of bar predictions as a percentage of bar high/low (min 0). |

## The Expert Advisor

`LorentzianClassification_EA` is a **thin wrapper** that is deliberately simple: it loads the
indicator (via `iCustom`) and trades the signals the indicator draws — nothing more. It opens a
position on the buy/sell arrows, and can optionally close on exit signals or reverse on an
opposite arrow.

It is intentionally kept thin so the parity work isn't buried under opinionated strategy logic —
it's a **clean starting point to build your own ideas on top of.**

> [!WARNING]
> **Trading involves substantial risk of loss.** This EA is a starter implementation intended to
> get you running in the Strategy Tester or on a demo account; it is not a complete risk-management
> system. Its default stop-loss and take-profit values are disabled, and enabling Algo Trading can
> place real market orders. Before any live use, you are responsible for implementing and validating
> appropriate position sizing, protective stops, exits, drawdown limits, and any broker-specific
> safeguards your strategy requires. We plan to expand the built-in controls over time, but the
> current release deliberately leaves risk management and exit design in your hands.

- ✅ **Its own controls up top** — lot size, optional stop-loss and take-profit, whether to use
  the indicator's exits, and a `min trades` guard (see below).
- ✅ **Everything below is a mirror of the indicator's inputs** — same names, same order, same
  defaults. During optimization every signal parameter is exposed and passed straight through to
  the indicator, with **no hidden translation**: what you see is exactly what the indicator sees.

<div align="center">

![The MetaTrader 5 Inputs dialog for the Lorentzian Classification EA](docs/assets/settings-inputs.png)

<sub><i>The EA's Inputs tab — its own controls under <b>EA Settings</b> (lot size, magic number,
stop-loss / take-profit, close-on-exit, and the <b>Min trades</b> Custom-max Sortino gate), with
the full indicator inputs mirrored below, one-to-one with TradingView.</i></sub>

</div>

### Backtesting & optimization

Run the EA through MetaTrader 5's **Strategy Tester** to backtest and optimize properly. The EA
ships with a custom optimization criterion that MetaTrader 5 does not include out of the box:

- ✅ **Trade-weighted Sortino ratio.** Set the optimizer's pass criterion to **Custom max** and it
  ranks runs by risk-adjusted return instead of raw profit.
- ✅ **`min trades`** discards lucky low-sample runs that look great but mean nothing — so you
  optimize on a real sample size.

And because of the parity, whatever settings you land on in the optimizer behave the same way
back on TradingView.

## Repository Layout

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| [`VERSION`](VERSION) | Canonical MQL5 release version shared by the indicator, EA, and binary-release tags. |
| [`indicators/`](indicators/) | The MT5 `Indicators` payload: `LorentzianClassification.mq5` with its `Include/` headers (features, filters, kernels, ANN, trade stats) and `PORTING_NOTES.md`. |
| [`experts/`](experts/) | The MT5 `Experts` payload: `LorentzianClassification_EA.mq5`, a thin EA wrapper that loads the indicator via `iCustom` and trades its signals. |

## Binary releases

The Releases page provides two channels:

- **`mql5-latest`** is a rolling prerelease rebuilt after relevant MQL5 source changes reach
  `main`. Its assets are replaced in place for users who always want the newest build.
- **`mql5-vX.Y`** releases are immutable historical versions. The first successful `main` build
  for a new [`VERSION`](VERSION) creates the matching tag and preserves both `.ex5` binaries and
  their SHA-256 checksums.

Every MQL5 source change must advance `VERSION` and the single `#property version "X.Y"`
declaration in both the indicator and EA. The release workflow rejects mismatches, rejects an
already-released version during pull-request validation, and refuses to overwrite an existing
versioned tag or release.

## Installation

1. In MetaTrader 5, open **File > Open Data Folder** and enter `MQL5/`.
2. Copy `indicators/LorentzianClassification/` into `MQL5/Indicators/` and
   `experts/LorentzianClassification_EA.mq5` into `MQL5/Experts/`.
3. Compile both `.mq5` files in MetaEditor (F7), or from the command line:

   ```
   MetaEditor64.exe /compile:"<data-folder>\MQL5\Indicators\LorentzianClassification\LorentzianClassification.mq5" /inc:"<data-folder>\MQL5" /log
   MetaEditor64.exe /compile:"<data-folder>\MQL5\Experts\LorentzianClassification_EA.mq5" /inc:"<data-folder>\MQL5" /log
   ```

The indicator can be attached to a chart standalone; the EA is used for Strategy Tester backtests
and automated trading and requires the compiled indicator (it declares it via
`#property tester_indicator`). Set the optimizer's pass criterion to **Custom max** to rank by the
trade-weighted Sortino ratio.

## Platform Notes

- **No `input group` lines in the indicator.** In MT5, an `input group` line
  consumes an `iCustom()` positional parameter slot, which would silently
  shift every EA-supplied input into the wrong parameter. The indicator uses
  plain comments as section separators and exposes exactly 45 slots that
  align 1:1 with the EA's `iCustom` call; keep them in sync when adding
  inputs.
- **Closed-bar processing.** Each bar is processed exactly once when it
  closes; the still-forming bar is deferred. Signals therefore persist on
  closed bars for `iCustom` readers and do not repaint.

## Validation

The port tracks the same TradingView / Pine gold baselines used by the Python, Rust, and Lean
ports:

- feature and kernel values within `1e-6`;
- prediction, direction, entry, and exit signal columns matched exactly;
- platform differences for MT5 data handling documented in
  [`PORTING_NOTES.md`](indicators/LorentzianClassification/PORTING_NOTES.md).

See [`docs/validation.md`](../../docs/validation.md) for the full cross-port validation policy.

## Source

The complete MQL5 source is published on GitHub under the AI Edge organization, alongside the
PineScript, Python, Rust, and Lean 4 ports — same repo, same home, just a new language added to
the family.

## Risk Disclosure

Trading involves significant risk of loss. This software classifies historical market states and
surfaces signals for evaluation by the trader; it does **not** guarantee profitable outcomes, and
past classification performance does not predict future results.
