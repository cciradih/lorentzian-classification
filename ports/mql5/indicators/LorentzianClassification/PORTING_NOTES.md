# Porting Notes: PineScript → MQL5

This document captures the PineScript equivalents and compatibility notes that
guided the MQL5 implementation of the Lorentzian Classification indicator. It
exists so the source files themselves can stay clean for open-source consumers
while the line-by-line correspondence with jdehorty's original PineScript
remains available for anyone auditing the port or making parity changes.

## Language-level translations

| PineScript concept | MQL5 equivalent in this port |
|---|---|

| `nz(x)` / `nz(x, fallback)` | `NZ(x)` / `NZ(x, fallback)` helper |
| `ta.ema(src, n)` | `CalcEMA(src, n, out, begin, total)`: SMA-seeded alpha recurrence, alpha = 2/(n+1) |
| `ta.sma(src, n)` | `CalcSMA(src, n, out, begin, total)` |
| `ta.rma(src, n)` | `CalcRMA(src, n, out, begin, total)`: SMA-seeded, alpha = 1/n |
| `ta.atr(n)` | `CalcATR(high, low, close, n, out, tr, begin, total)` |
| `ta.rsi(src, n)` | `CalcRSI(src, n, out, ...)` |

| Fixed-range rescale | `ApplyRescale(src, oldMin, oldMax, newMin, newMax)` |
| `var x = ...` persistent series | MQL5 `static` locals or members of `ANNState` / `FilterState` that are reset only when `prev_calculated == 0` |
| `src[4] < src[0]` (backward-indexed lookback) | Forward-indexed `src[i - 4] < src[i]` inside the bar loop |
| `display=display.none` hidden plot | MQL5 `DRAW_NONE` buffers (e.g. `DirectionBuf`, `PredictionBuf`) |

### `na` propagation semantics

In PineScript, any arithmetic involving `na` yields `na`. A comparison
involving `na` evaluates to `false`. The MQL5 port preserves these semantics
by propagating `LC_EMPTY` through dependent calculations and by explicitly
guarding comparisons against `LC_EMPTY`.

Example: in the Lorentzian distance, any `na` operand in `math.log(1 + ...)`
makes the whole distance `na`, so `d >= lastDistance` is falsy and the
candidate is silently skipped. `GetLorentzianDistance` emulates this by
returning `-DBL_MAX` when any active feature (current or history) is
`LC_EMPTY`, guaranteeing the caller's `d >= lastDistance` test fails for any
typical `lastDistance` (including the initial value of `-1.0`).

### Bar-0 `nz()` defaults

PineScript frequently writes `nz(close[1])` to read the previous bar's close
with a default of `0` on bar 0. The MQL5 port mirrors this by using a
`(i > 0) ? x[i - 1] : 0` pattern in the same places (ATR, ADX, ADX filter).

### Truthiness of integers

PineScript treats a nonzero integer as truthy. `d >= lastDistance and i%4`
relies on this: when `i % 4 == 0` the expression is falsy. The MQL5 port
makes this explicit as `(i % 4) != 0`.

### `array.from(_src)` in kernel loops

The PineScript kernel functions loop
`for i = 0 to array.size(array.from(_src)) + startAtBar`. Since
`array.from(_src)` is a one-element array, `array.size = 1`, giving an
effective loop range of `0..(1 + startAtBar)`. The MQL5 port writes this
directly as `int limit = 1 + startAtBar;` and then
`for(int i = 0; i <= limit && i <= barIndex; i++)`.

|---|---|---|
| Background (Euclidean vs Lorentzian) | 10-106 | File header block in `.mq5` |
| Custom types | 115-163 | Represented as C-style `struct`s in include files (`ANNState`, `FilterState`, `FeatureWork`, etc.) |
| Helper functions (`series_from`, `get_lorentzian_distance`) | 168-190 | `CalcFeature()` (MLFeatures.mqh), `GetLorentzianDistance()` (ANN.mqh) |
| Settings inputs | 197-211, 232-315 | `input` declarations at the top of `.mq5` |

### `Include/MLFeatures.mqh` ↔ `MLExtensions.pine`

| Pine function | MQL5 function |
|---|---|
| `MLExtensions.n_rsi(src, n1, n2)` | `CalcNormalizedRSI(src, n1, n2, out, ...)` |
| `MLExtensions.n_wt(hlc3, n1, n2)` | `CalcWaveTrend(src, n1, n2, out, ..., normState)` |
| `MLExtensions.n_cci(src, n1, n2)` | `CalcNormalizedCCI(src, n1, n2, out, ..., normState)` |
| `MLExtensions.n_adx(high, low, close, n)` | `CalcADX(high, low, close, n, out, ...)` (output rescaled to [0,1]) |
| `MLExtensions.rescale(x, oldMin, oldMax, newMin, newMax)` | `ApplyRescale(...)` |
| `MLExtensions.normalize(x, outMin, outMax)` | `ApplyNormalize(x, outMin, outMax, normState)` |
| `MLExtensions.filter_volatility(min, max, useFilter)` | `GetVolatilityFilter(fs, i, useFilter)` |
| `MLExtensions.regime_filter(ohlc4, threshold, useFilter)` | `GetRegimeFilter(fs, i, threshold, useFilter)` with state computed in `CalcRegimeFilter` |

| `MLExtensions.backtest(...)` | `UpdateBacktest()` / `DrawStatsTable()` |

Numerical parity: the math inside each of the `Calc*` helpers mirrors the
PineScript library exactly, including seeding and warmup rules. The
boundary conditions (bar 0 behaviour, `na` treatment) are documented
inline where they matter.

### `Include/KernelFunctions.mqh` ↔ `KernelFunctions.pine`

| Pine function | MQL5 function |
|---|---|
| `kernels.rationalQuadratic(src, h, r, x)` | `KernelRationalQuadratic(src, barIndex, lookback, relativeWeight, startAtBar)` |
| `kernels.gaussian(src, h, x)` | `KernelGaussian(src, barIndex, lookback, startAtBar)` |

Semantics preserved:
- Non-repainting: the MQL5 versions only read `src[barIndex - i]` for `i >= 0`.
- Loop range: `0..(1 + startAtBar)`, clamped to available history.
- Edge fallback: if `cumulativeWeight <= 0` (no usable history), return
  `src[barIndex]` instead of dividing by zero.

### `Include/Filters.mqh`

- **Volatility filter**: ATR(1) > ATR(10) (periods fixed in the call site).
  During warmup (ATR values still `LC_EMPTY`) the filter returns `true`
  so early bars are not suppressed.
- **Regime filter**: ports `MLExtensions.regime_filter`, a Kaufman-style
  adaptive slope. State variables `value1`, `value2`, `KLMF`, `absSlope`,
  `emaAbsSlope(200)` are persisted in `FilterState` and computed
  bar-by-bar because the recurrence is order-dependent.
- **ADX filter**: port of `MLExtensions.filter_adx` with a hardcoded
  period 14 at the call site. Computed independently from `FEATURE_ADX`
  (which is additionally rescaled to [0,1] for ML consumption).
- **EMA / SMA trend filters**: classical `close > MA` / `close < MA`
  gates; used at the entry stage, not the signal-flip gate.

### `Include/ANN.mqh`

Ports the core ML loop and state. Persistent queues (`distances`,
`predictions`) correspond to `var` arrays in the original PineScript; they
accumulate over the full history so that the neighbor pool is not reset
each bar. `lastDistance` is intentionally NOT persistent (matches
PineScript -- there is no `var` on it) and resets to `-1` every call.

The loop bound in the MQL5 port is `sizeLoop = min(maxBarsBack - 1, dataSize - 1)`,
equivalent to the PineScript
`size = min(maxBarsBack - 1, array.size(y_train_array) - 1); sizeLoop = min(maxBarsBack - 1, size)`.

### `Include/Backtest.mqh`

Ports `MLExtensions.backtest(...)`. The original PineScript additionally
emits a hidden `backTestStream` plot with codes `+1` (startLong),
`+2` (endLong), `-1` (startShort), `-2` (endShort) for downstream adapters.
The MQL5 port does not re-expose that stream as a separate indicator
buffer; chart consumers read the `BuyBuf` / `SellBuf` / `ExitBuyBuf` /
`ExitSellBuf` outputs directly, which carry the same information.

## Divergences from the original

The port is faithful to the algorithm but has two cosmetic differences
worth noting:

1. **Bar-colour gradient midpoint.** PineScript's `color.from_gradient`
   fades weak predictions toward neutral gray `#787b86`. The MQL5 palette
   in `OnInit` fades toward white instead, so low-magnitude predictions
   appear washed out rather than greyed out. The saturated endpoints
   (`#009988` teal and `#CC3311` red) are identical.
2. **No alerts.** PineScript exposes `alertcondition(...)` for each event;
   MQL5 consumers are expected to read the signal buffers from an EA or
   to subscribe to `OnChartEvent` externally. Adding `Alert()` calls in
   the indicator body would be straightforward if needed.

## Parity checklist for future changes

When updating either side to stay in sync, the following should be
verified in lockstep:

- Feature order and defaults (RSI/WT/CCI/ADX/RSI with periods 14/10-11/20-1/20-2/9-1).
- Training label formula: `src[i-4] < src[i] ? short : src[i-4] > src[i] ? long : neutral`.
- ANN loop: `(i % 4) != 0` gating, 75th-percentile `lastDistance` bump,
  FIFO shift when the queue exceeds `neighborsCount`.
- Filter combination: `filterAll = vol AND regime AND adx`; EMA/SMA are
  entry-level only.
- Kernel parameters: `yhat1 = rationalQuadratic(src, h, r, x)`,
  `yhat2 = gaussian(src, h - lag, x)`.
- Exit-mode selection: dynamic exits are only valid when EMA, SMA, and
  kernel smoothing are all disabled.
